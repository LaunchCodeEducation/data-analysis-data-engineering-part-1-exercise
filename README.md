# Data Engineering Part-1 Exercise

## Exercise instructions

We want you to create a [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for datasets 1, 2, and 3. 
Each dataset is organized into a folder containing .csv files for all parts of the dataset.

### Before creating your ERD for a dataset, we recommend you investigate the data using the following steps:
1. Explore the data: 
    - Create a single Excel file to hold all .csv files for a dataset. 
    - Import the data from each .csv file into its own sheet tab
    - Review the overall data in this format, looking for relationships and inconsistencies in the data
    - Highlight fields with mixed types or inconsistent formats, and add comments in Excel.
2. Profile and Normalize the data: 
    - Decide appropriate data types and constraints for the data in each .csv tab 
    - Decide on the relationships to define between fields in different .csv tabs

### When creating your dbdiagram.io ERD we want you to:
- Identify entities, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- Draw relationships (cardinalities) and note optional vs. required links.
- Add brief comments on columns that require cleaning or should remain TEXT/VARCHAR due to variability in the field's data.

## Deliverable:

- When you are done, create a .txt file named `dataset-[dataset number]-solution.txt` for each dataset and paste in your final dbdiagram.io ERD code into the file
- Push your changes to the Github repo you created for this exercise, and submit a link to your repo in Canvas
